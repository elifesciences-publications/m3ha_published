function isPositiveVector = ispositivevector (x)
%% Returns whether an input is a positive vector
% Usage: isPositiveVector = ispositivevector (x)
% Explanation:
%       Tests whether the input is a positive vector
% Example(s):
%       ispositivevector(1:10)
%       ispositivevector(magic(3))
%       ispositivevector(-1:3)
% Outputs:
%       isPositiveVector
%                       - whether the input is a positive vector
%                       specified as a logical scalar
