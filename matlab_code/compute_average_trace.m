function [avgTrace, paramsUsed] = compute_average_trace (traces, varargin)
%% Computes the average of traces that are not necessarily the same length
% Usage: [avgTrace, paramsUsed] = compute_average_trace (traces, varargin)
% Explanation:
%       TODO
% Example(s):
%       TODO
% Outputs:
%       avgTrace    - the average trace
% Arguments:    
%       traces      - traces to average
%                   Note: If a non-vector array, each column is a vector
%                   must be a numeric array or a cell array
%       varargin    - Any other parameter-value pair for compute_combined_trace()
%                   
% Requires:
%       cd/compute_combined_trace.m
%
% Used by:
%       cd/compute_average_pulse_response.m
%       cd/find_passive_params.m
