function nAsEachC = count_A_each_C (nAsEachB, nBsEachC)
%% Counts the number of (A)s in each (C) based on the number of (A)s in each (B) and the number of (B)s in each (C)
% Usage: nAsEachC = count_A_each_C (nAsEachB, nBsEachC)
% Explanation:
%       TODO
% Example(s):
%       count_A_each_C([3, 4, 3, 2, 1], [2; 3])
%       count_A_each_C([3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4], [2; 3])
% Outputs:
%       nAsEachC    - number of (A)s in each (C)
%                   specified as a numeric vector
% Arguments:
%       nAsEachB    - number of (A)s in each (B)
%                   must be  a numeric vector
%       nBsEachC    - the number of (B)s in each (C)
%                   must be  a numeric vector
