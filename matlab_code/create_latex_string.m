%% Deal with arguments
% Check number of required arguments
if nargin < 1
    error(create_error_for_nargin(mfilename));
end

% Set up Input Parser Scheme
iP = inputParser;
iP.FunctionName = mfilename;

% Add required inputs to the Input Parser
addRequired(iP, 'equation', ...
    @(x) validateattributes(x, {'char'}, {'2d'}));

% Read from the Input Parser
parse(iP, equation, varargin{:});

%% Do the job
% Replace the exponentials
equation = replace(equation, '*exp(', '*e^{');
equation = replace(equation, 'exp(', 'e^{');

% Remove the * if unnecessary
equation = replace(equation, '*(', '(');

% Replace <= with \leq
equation = replace(equation, '<=', '\leq');

% Count the number of characters
nChars = numel(equation);

% Replace the matching ')' for each '{' with '}'
nLeft = 0;          % the number of left parenthesis encountered so far
toDetect = false;   % whether a '{' was encountered
for iChar = 1:nChars
    % Get this character 
    thisChar = equation(iChar);

    % Test the character
    if thisChar == '{'
        % Start detection
        toDetect = true;

        % Increment nLeft and start detection
        nLeft = nLeft + 1;
    elseif thisChar == '(' && toDetect
        % Increment nLeft and start detection
        nLeft = nLeft + 1;
    elseif thisChar == ')' && toDetect
        % Decrement nLeft
        nLeft = nLeft - 1;

        % If there is no nLeft left, then we need to replace the character
        %   and end detection
        if nLeft == 0
            % Replace with '}'
            equation(iChar) = '}';

            % Set detect flag to be false
            toDetect = false;
        end
    end
end

% Prepend and append with '$$'
equation = ['$$', equation, '$$'];

%% Output results
equationLatex = equation;
