function vectors = force_row_vector (vectors, varargin)
%% Transform column vector(s) or array(s) to row vector(s)
% Usage: vectors = force_row_vector (vectors, varargin)
% Explanation:
%       Starting with a cell array of mixed vectors, some row and some column,
%           this function makes sure each vector is a row vector.
%       If a single vector is provided, the function makes sure 
%           it's a row vector.
%
% Example(s):
%       vector = force_row_vector(vector);
%       vectors = force_row_vector(vectors);
%       force_row_vector({[3, 4], [5; 6], magic(3)})
%
% Outputs:
%       vectors     - vectors transformed
%
% Arguments:
%       vectors     - original vectors
%       varargin    - see force_column_vector.m

%% Do the job
