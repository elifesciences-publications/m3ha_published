% Requires:    
%       cd/create_subdir_copy_files.m

% File History:
% 2016-10-19 Created
% 2016-12-05 Moved code to create_subdir_copy_files()
% 2016-12-05 Added All_Spontaneous_Spikes, Not_LTS_by_prom && Long_Latency_LTS
% 2016-12-06 Moved code to create_subdir_copy_files.m
% 2017-03-29 - BT - Changed varargin to read version number for new vtraces folder, updated to new file hierarchy

%% Parameters used in the analyses
lts_thr = -0.0023;        % 2nd derivative in V^2/s^2 below which defines an LTS peak
lts_thr_alt = -0.0081823;    % 2nd derivative in V^2/s^2 above which is the "gray area"

%% Set folders for reading and saving files

outFolder = '//media/adamX/m3ha/data_dclamp/take4/special_cases/';

%% Specify which matfile to use; assumed to be in inFolder
