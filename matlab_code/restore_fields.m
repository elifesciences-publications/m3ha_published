function [structure] = restore_fields (structure, varargin)
%% Set each field specified in varargin to previous values from the field strcat(field, '_prev')
% Usage: [structure] = restore_fields (structure, varargin)
% Arguments:
%   structure    - must include field & strcat(field, '_prev') for each field specified by varargin
%   varargin    - must include at least one argument
%              must be character arrays corresponding to numerical field values in structure
