function [abfPath, pathExists] = construct_and_check_abfpath (abfFileName, varargin)
%% Constructs the full path to a .abf file and checks whether it exists
% Usage: [abfPath, pathExists] = construct_and_check_abfpath (abfFileName, varargin)
% Explanation:
%       TODO
% Example(s):
%       TODO
% Outputs:
%       abfPath     - the full path(s) to .abf file(s) constructed
%                   specified as a character vector 
%                       or a column cell array or character vectors
%       pathExists  - whether the path(s) exists
%                   specified as a column logical array
% Arguments:
%       abfFileName - file or directory name(s)
%                       e.g. 'A100110_0008_18.mat'
%                       e.g. {'folder1', 'folder2'}
%                   must be a string/character array or a cell array 
%                       of strings/character arrays
%       varargin    - whatever accepted by construct_and_check_fullpath.m
